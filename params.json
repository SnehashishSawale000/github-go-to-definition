We'll scour the project for any definitions and let you open them in a new tab.\r\n\r\n[Get the extension!](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-ctags/mnmfgfhdkhohgigpepkfjfeigkhfjhdj)\r\n\r\n## How it works\r\n\r\nThe chrome extension is paired with a Sinatra server which, given a github repo, a commit hash and a token to search for, downloads the repo as a zip, generates a ctags file for it and searches the index for the token.\r\n\r\nFor public use, I've hosted this service on Google App Engine at https://github-ctags.gordn.org.\r\n\r\n## Running locally\r\n\r\nThis project contains a chrome extension (located in `/chrome_extension/`) and a Ruby Sinatra backend server.\r\n\r\n#### Server\r\nTo get the server running, you can either build a Docker image using the `Dockerfile` or follow the following instructions.  You'll need Ruby 2+ and Bundler installed.\r\n\r\n1. Install dependencies\r\n\r\n```\r\nbundle install\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll also need to have `ctags` installed.  Here's how to do that in Mac OS X:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbrew install ctags\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Run server (default port is 4567)\r\n\r\n```\r\nbundle exec ruby app.rb -p {PORT}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Whatever port this is running on, you'll want to update `chrome_extension/background.js` to point to `http://localhost:{PORT}/definition?...`\r\n\r\n#### Chrome extension\r\n\r\n1. Go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)\r\n2. Tick the 'Developer mode' checkbox\r\n3. Click 'Load unpacked extension...' and then open the `/chrome_extension/` directory from the file browser.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nAll suggestions and contributions are welcome!  Feel free to open up an issue or throw some pull requests over.",
